# ðŸŽ¬ Video Reels & Video Chat App  

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my little side project where I combined **video chat** and **Instagram-like reels** into a single Android app.  
Itâ€™s built in **Kotlin**, powered by the **Agora SDK** for real-time video calls, and has a smooth vertical video feed for reels.

## âœ¨ What it Can Do
- ðŸ“ž **Face-to-Face Video Calls** â€“ Real-time and super clear (thanks to Agora).  
- ðŸŽ¥ **Watch Reels** â€“ Swipe up & down through short videos, just like Instagram.  
- ðŸ–Œ **Clean, Modern UI** â€“ Material Design for that polished look.  
- âš¡ **Low Latency** â€“ Because nobody likes lag.  
- ðŸ›  **Made with Love** â€“ And a lot of coffee â˜•.

## ðŸ›  Tech Behind the Scenes
- **Language:** Kotlin (AndroidX)  
- **UI:** XML layouts + Material Components  
- **Video Streaming:** Agora Real-Time Engagement SDK  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **IDE:** Android Studio

## ðŸš€ How to Run it Yourself
1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/video-reels-videochat-app.git
2.Open in Android Studio

3.Add your Agora App ID and Token:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
const val APP_ID = "YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID"
const val TOKEN = "YOUR_AGORA_TOKEN"
const val CHANNEL_NAME = "testChannel"
ðŸ“Œ Note:

4.Agora temporary tokens expire after 24 hours.

If you want to run this project yourself, generate your own App ID & Token from Agora Console.

This is for security reasons, so your video calls remain private.

5.Sync Gradle and hit that â–¶ Run button!

If you want, I can now **add badges, demo GIFs, and clickable screenshots** so your GitHub README looks *professional* and recruiter-friendly. That will make it perfect for a CV project showcase.
